Object Detection Using Faster R-CNN Deep Learning

Taking the "EE4211_Computer Vision" class taught me the principles of image processing and allowed me to work on an object recognition project using deep learning.

The project was to evaluate and detect bird photos from the CUB-200-2011 dataset. 

The project's aim was to use MATLAB to train 1,000 photos and test 300 data sets.
